Installation
============

Releases are available on pypi, and can be installed with `pip`:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install rpy2-arrow
  
To install the development version with `pip`:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -e git://github.com/rpy2/rpy2-arrow.git@main#egg=rpy2_arrow

The package allows the sharing of `Apache Arrow <https://arrow.apache.org/>`_
data structures (Array, ChunkedArray, Field, RecordBatch, RecordBatchReader,
Table, Schema) between Python and R
within the same process. The underlying C/C++ pointer is shared,
meaning potentially large gain in performance compared to regular
arrays or data frames shared between Python and R through the
conversion rules included in :mod:`rpy2`. When used with a test
:class:`pandas.DataFrame` with half a million rows, making that data
availble to R was measured to be 200 times faster with the use of Arrow
(see :ref:`conversion`).

.. note::

   The R package `arrow` >= 3.0.0 is required. The current version of
   :mod:`rpy2_arrow` is even targeting `arrow` > v5.0.

   The latest released version of the R package can be installed in R with:

   .. code-block:: r

      install.packages("arrow")
